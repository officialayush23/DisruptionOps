/** The allocation ledger. Who is on what, what is spare, what nobody has.
 *
 *  The system assigns — CP-SAT solves it, the gate authorises it, the replanner
 *  revisits it. This screen does not. Its whole job is to make what the system
 *  decided legible, which until now was possible only by hovering coloured
 *  lines on a map: the map answers "where", and the question is "what is this
 *  unit attached to, and why that one".
 *
 *  Three tables, because the question has three halves and an officer asks them
 *  in this order:
 *
 *    **Assigned** — every committed unit, the incident it is attached to, the
 *    hazard behind that incident, how many reports built it, how far out it is,
 *    and which actor made the attachment. One row per unit, so "where is
 *    Ambulance 4" is a scan rather than a search.
 *
 *    **Spare** — what is left. The other half of every coverage question, and
 *    the one a map cannot show, because an idle unit looks exactly like a busy
 *    one from above.
 *
 *    **Nobody has it** — demand with no unit against it. Not a failure to
 *    display: the solver records these deliberately rather than quietly
 *    under-serving them, and this is where they surface.
 *
 *  Everything is derived from the one poll the console already runs. No new
 *  request, and no number on this screen that another screen could disagree
 *  with.
