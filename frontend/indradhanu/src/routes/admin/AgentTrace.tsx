 *  Two views of the same append-only table, because it answers two questions.
 *  The one at the top — *what got attached to what* — is the one an officer
 *  asks while an event is running, and it was unanswerable: the raw log says
 *  `assignment.changed`, a uuid, and a JSON payload, and reading it requires
 *  knowing which key in which payload holds the other end of the join. The raw
 *  rows stay underneath, with their causation chain, because that is what an
 *  auditor wants and it is the thing nothing else can reconstruct.
 *
 *  Nothing here is generated for the screen. A database trigger refuses updates
 *  to `events`, so every row below was written by the actor named on it, at the
 *  time shown, with the payload shown.
