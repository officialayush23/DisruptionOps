/** Push, with polling underneath it.
 *
 *  Every screen used to converge on its own four-second timer, which meant an
 *  officer approving a decision and the crew seeing it were separated by up to
 *  four seconds of nothing — and during a flood the interesting moments are
 *  exactly the ones where two people are looking at the same thing.
 *
 *  Supabase Realtime carries the Postgres write-ahead log to the browser, so a
 *  row changing in `incidents` reaches every subscriber in tens of
 *  milliseconds. What it does **not** do is guarantee delivery: a websocket on a
 *  congested municipal network drops, and a screen that stopped polling because
 *  it trusted the socket would then sit there confidently showing a stale city.
 *
 *  So this is deliberately not a replacement for the poll. It is a **hint that
 *  something changed**, and the caller's existing `refresh()` remains the only
 *  thing that reads state. The poll stays, slowed down while the channel is
 *  genuinely subscribed and returning to its normal rate the moment it is not.
 *  The failure mode of the socket is therefore "back to how it worked before",
 *  which is the only failure mode worth having in a system somebody evacuates a
 *  street on.
 *
 *  Row-level security is the access boundary and it already says the right
 *  thing: `alerts`, `incidents` and `ward_risks` are readable by `anon`, so the
 *  resident app subscribes without an account; `decisions` and `field_tasks`
 *  are `authenticated` only, so a subscription from the public page receives
 *  nothing rather than being refused loudly. Realtime enforces the same
 *  policies as a query — there is no second place to get this wrong.
