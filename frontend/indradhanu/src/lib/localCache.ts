/** A small persistent key-value cache in IndexedDB, with an in-memory mirror.
 *
 *  Used for the things that make the console slow to *start* rather than slow
 *  to run: ward boundaries (most of the first snapshot's bytes), the last
 *  snapshot of the world (so the wall draws instantly on a cold Render and says
 *  it is cached until the live one lands), and a picture of each map screen (so
 *  a screen shows its last image while Mapbox builds the real one).
 *
 *  Everything is best-effort. Private browsing, blocked storage or a full disk
 *  make every call a quiet no-op; nothing here may break a screen.
