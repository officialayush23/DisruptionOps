/** What each nav badge counts, and how loudly to say it.
 *
 *  A badge means **a person has to do something here**, not "this screen has
 *  content". That distinction is the whole design: the moment every tab carries
 *  a number, none of them mean anything and an officer learns to ignore the
 *  sidebar — which is worse than having had no badges at all, because the two
 *  that genuinely block a decision are now buried in noise.
 *
 *  So only queues are counted, and in two registers:
 *
 *    **blocked** — the system has stopped and is waiting for a human. The gate
 *    is the archetype: a decision that will not issue until somebody approves
 *    it. Amber, the same colour the gate already used.
 *
 *    **gap** — nothing is blocked, but there is a hole an officer would want to
 *    close: a demand nobody can serve, a crew off the road, a capability the
 *    forecast says is about to run short. Quieter, because it is a shortfall
 *    rather than an instruction.
 *
 *  Screens that are records or tools — the console, the copilot, the agent
 *  trace, issued alerts, replay, after-action, the architecture page and
 *  configuration — carry nothing. Nobody is waiting on them.
