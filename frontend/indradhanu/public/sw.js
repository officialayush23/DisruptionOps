/* Indradhanu service worker.
 *
 * This exists for one situation: somebody opens the app during a flood, on a
 * phone, on a network that is congested or gone. What it has to do in that
 * situation is not "be fast" — it is **not lose the report**.
 *
 * Three behaviours, in order of how much they matter:
 *
 *   1. **A report survives having no signal.** A failed POST of a report is
 *      written to IndexedDB and replayed when connectivity returns, through
 *      Background Sync where the browser supports it and on the next load where
 *      it does not. The report carries its own `occurredAt`, and the intake
 *      pipeline already accepts one, so a report that syncs an hour late is
 *      still scored against the moment it was made rather than the moment it
 *      arrived.
 *   2. **The last known world is readable offline.** Guidance and surroundings
 *      are cached as they are fetched, and served stale with a header saying so
 *      when the network fails. Stale information clearly marked as stale beats a
 *      spinner.
 *   3. **The shell loads.** Standard precache, so the app opens on a dead
 *      network instead of showing the browser's offline page.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* cached: anything under /api/v1/demo or /config. A control
 * room screen must never show a stale world silently, and a configuration
 * screen must never write against a stale one.

 * Vite's asset names are content-hashed, so every deploy produces a new URL,
 * which `cacheFirst` stores and nothing ever removed: `activate` only deletes
 * caches whose name does not start with VERSION, and VERSION is a constant
 * nobody remembers to bump. A phone that has visited across ten deploys was
 * keeping ten JS bundles, ten stylesheets and ten copies of the font — growth
 * with no ceiling, on exactly the cheap handset this app is meant for.
 *
 * A ceiling is the right fix rather than a version bump, because it needs no
 * discipline at deploy time. One build's assets are a handful of files, so this
 * holds the current build comfortably and lets the one before it age out.
 * Entries are evicted oldest-first: `cache.keys()` returns insertion order. */
