"""The run.

This is the module that was missing. Everything around it existed already:
hazard adapters that score wards, a CP-SAT solver that assigns units, a policy
gate that decides what may issue without a human, and a schema to hold all of
it. Nothing joined them up, which is why every operational table in the
database was empty. This joins them up.

One run does the whole loop:

    signal -> score -> impact -> proposed actions -> policy gate -> decisions
           -> demands -> travel matrix -> allocation -> assignments
           -> field tasks -> alerts

and appends an event for every step, with the id of the event that caused it,
so the console can answer "why did that boat get sent there?" by walking a
chain rather than guessing.

Two rules hold throughout, and they are the reason this is defensible:

  * The model never produces a number. Risk comes from adapters, allocation
    from CP-SAT, authority from the policy corpus. The LLM writes prose. Pull
    the model out entirely and the run still completes; it just explains itself
    in plainer language and says `engine: fallback`.

  * Nothing reads the wall clock. Time comes from the injected `Clock`, so this
    same function is what a simulation and a replay run. There is no separate
    demo path to drift out of sync with production.
