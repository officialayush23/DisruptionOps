"""Re-allocation, when the world changes.

The hazard run produces a plan once. This produces the next one, and the
difference between those two jobs is the whole of PS20's "dynamic re-allocation
on new reports".

Re-planning naively is worse than not re-planning. Solve from scratch on every
new report and the entire city reshuffles every few seconds: units that were
two minutes from a rescue turn around because some arithmetic found a marginally
better global arrangement, and the field stops trusting the screen. So this
does three things a fresh solve does not:

  * it tells the solver what every unit is **already committed to**, and how far
    along it is, so moving one costs something and moving one that is nearly
    there costs a lot;
  * it returns a **diff**, not a plan. Kept, reassigned, newly assigned,
    released, uncovered. The console shows what changed and why, which is the
    only form an officer can actually check;
  * it is **debounced**. Ten reports arriving in twenty seconds produce one
    re-plan, not ten.

Demand comes from incident needs rather than from reports, because four reports
of one flooded road need one pump between them.
