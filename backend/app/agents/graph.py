"""The agent graph, on LangGraph.

This is the cycle the event router runs whenever the world changes (a report,
an incident, a road block, a crew update). It does the CP-SAT solve with the
steps visible, a human-approval stop for the decisions that should not be
automatic, a checkpoint per step, and three kinds of control around every
agent:

  **Strict state.** Each node is declared with the state keys it may READ and
  the keys it may WRITE (`@contract`). It is handed a read-only view of only its
  reads; anything it returns is checked against its writes and validated
  against the schema (pydantic) before LangGraph merges it. A node that writes a
  key it does not own, or a value of the wrong shape, fails the step instead of
  corrupting the run. Fan-out nodes (`sense`, `domain`) get a validated payload
  and never see the shared state at all.

  **Guardrails** (app/agents/guardrails.py). Input: any text headed for a model
  is cleaned, PII-redacted and injection-checked. Output: model answers must
  pass a schema. Action: a plan is checked for double-assigned units, how many
  units it moves in one cycle, and whether coverage drops; the last two send it
  to an officer. Run: every run has a timeout and a recursion limit.

  **Per-agent memory** (app/agents/agent_memory.py). Each agent has its own
  namespace and an access list; officers' standing orders are readable by all
  and writable by none of them; reads, writes and refusals go to a ledger. The
  memory is used, not decorative: a domain planner that has been short of the
  same capability three cycles running says so and flags mutual aid; the gate
  remembers an officer's rejection and does not ask the same question again for
  thirty minutes.

When `langgraph` is not installed the router falls back to the direct re-plan,
so the system never depends on this module to function.
