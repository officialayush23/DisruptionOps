"""Resource allocation.

The model proposes and explains; this decides the numbers.

Formulated as a constrained assignment problem and solved with OR-Tools
CP-SAT. If the solver is unavailable or hits its time budget, a greedy
nearest-first heuristic takes over and the result says so — a dispatch plan
that silently degrades is worse than one that admits it degraded.

What the objective actually minimises is population-weighted arrival time:
sending the only free boat to the ward with 40 people rather than the one with
2,300 is arithmetically defensible, and an officer can see why.
