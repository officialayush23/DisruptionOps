"""The event log.

Every state change in the system is appended here before anyone reads it back.
One table doing four jobs:

  * the PS20 activity and audit log
  * the trigger for reactive replanning (a new event is what wakes the planner)
  * the tape a replay reads back
  * the causal chain the console shows when an officer asks "why did that boat
    get re-tasked?"

Two timestamps, and the difference matters. `occurred_at` is world time: when
the thing happened, on whichever clock the scope is running. `recorded_at` is
wall time: when it reached us. They are usually a millisecond apart and
occasionally forty minutes, which is exactly the case a relayed report from a
device that was offline creates. Ordering by `occurred_at` and auditing by
`recorded_at` is what keeps a late arrival from being treated as a new fact.

The table is append-only, enforced by a trigger rather than by convention. An
audit log you can quietly rewrite is not an audit log.
