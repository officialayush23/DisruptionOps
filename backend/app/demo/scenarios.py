"""Named, scripted cases: for the stage, and as regression checks against the DB.

The random demo shows the system working. These show it working *on purpose*:
each one sets up a specific situation the judges ask about, lets the real
pipeline (intake, trust, dedup, needs, CP-SAT, re-plan, gate, executor, mesh)
handle it, and then checks the outcome against what should have happened.
Nothing in a scenario touches allocation directly; every step goes through the
same door a person, a crew, a camera or the mesh would use.

    GET  /api/v1/demo/scenarios              the list
    POST /api/v1/demo/scenarios/{name}/run   run one; progress appears as beats
    GET  /api/v1/demo/scenarios/last         steps and checks of the last run

Scenarios
---------
  flood_cascade        several reports of one flooded road in a minute:
                       one incident, not five; a pump goes once
  block_on_approach    a crew reports the road it is driving is closed:
                       that unit, and only that unit, is re-routed, once
  unit_breakdown       a committed unit breaks down mid-route:
                       its job is covered by another unit on the next plan
  officer_redirect     an officer cancels a unit and sends it elsewhere:
                       the next three re-plans do not undo it
  officer_hold         an officer stands a unit down and holds it:
                       the planner does not task it while held
  camera_fire_mesh     a camera sees fire while its ward has no internet;
                       the packet arrives over the mesh: one incident, and a
                       dispatch goes back into the mesh outbox
  mesh_blackout_sos    three people report over the mesh, one packet heard by
                       two gateways: two reports, one duplicate, zero spoofs
  multi_hazard_surge   fire, collapse and stranded people across wards at
                       once: the shortfall is recorded, not hidden
  ghaziabad_monsoon    a monsoon night around IPEC, Ghaziabad: local units
                       (not Pune's) are tasked
