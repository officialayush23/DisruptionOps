"""DisruptionOps -> drone swarm: ask the swarm (an external agency) for aerial help and ingest what it reports.

From the drone_swarm repo integration kit (swarm_ops/integrations/disruptionops_patch), installed into DisruptionOps.
Extended by app/drone/swarm_link.py (filtered log, panel tasking, recheck-and-replan reasoner).
Apply with migration 040_drone_swarm_agency.sql (registers the 'drone-swarm' agency and the capabilities
aerial_assessment / supply_drop / relay as data) and the two-line hook in main.py described in README.md.

What it does
------------
1. Every SCAN_S seconds it looks for open incidents that want aerial help:
     * the incident needs ``field_assessment`` (an ``unknown_report``)            -> swarm request kind ``assess``
     * its category is ``life_safety`` and nobody has confirmed it from the air   -> ``sos``
     * it needs ``supply_delivery`` (a relief point running out)                  -> ``supply``
   and sends one ``agency_request`` over the swarm's WebSocket (``/ops/ws``, protocol disruptionops.swarm.v2,
   integration token) with the situation: category, people, vulnerable people, hazards, location (lng/lat and
   the swarm's local metres), ward, and the ground units that are free right now.
   The request is also recorded with the existing inter-agency workflow (``reports.request_agency``) so the
   console shows it, and every transition is an event (actor ``sensor:drone-swarm``).
2. It reads the swarm's status events (accepted / declined / briefing / resource_request / supply_delivered /
   completed ...) from the same socket and writes them back ONLY through doors that already exist:
     * ``world.events.append``                 an audit event ``drone.<status>`` on the incident
     * ``agency_replies.record``               the swarm's ack becomes the agency's reply (accept_full / delayed /
                                              decline_capacity / decline_jurisdiction), not the random REPLY_SET
     * ``incidents.intake.receive(source='sensor')``  for a swarm ``resource_request`` the swarm saw on scene
       (trust, dedup, needs-from-words and the allocator take it from there; the CP-SAT planner still picks units)
   It never writes tables directly, never resolves an incident (a person does that) and never assigns a unit.
3. It stands down when a person wants it to:
     * ``autonomy.paused()`` (emergency stop, control_state key 'autonomy'): no new request is sent and no
       swarm resource_request is filed; the swarm's reports are still logged as events.
     * an active ``operator_overrides`` row on the incident, or a human having declined / cancelled the
       agency request: no new request, and a swarm resource_request is logged, not filed.

Environment (all optional; ``SWARM_AGENCY=1`` switches it on):
    SWARM_AGENCY             1 to start with the app (default 0)
    SWARM_WS_URL             wss://<swarm-host>/ops/ws            (the swarm's OPS WebSocket)
    SWARM_INTEGRATION_TOKEN  the swarm's OPS_INTEGRATION_TOKEN (never logged)
    SWARM_ANCHOR             "lat,lon" of the swarm map origin   (default 18.6526632,73.7624378, PCCOE)
    SWARM_SCAN_S             scan period seconds (default 10)
    SWARM_ORCHESTRATE        1 to also push planner assignments to the swarm (orchestrate_incident)
    SWARM_MAX_OPEN           most unanswered requests at once (default 6)

Everything here imports ``app.*`` lazily, so the pure helpers can be unit-tested without a DisruptionOps checkout.
