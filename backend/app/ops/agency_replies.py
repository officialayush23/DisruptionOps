"""The other agency answers a handoff, and the coordinator acts on the answer.

A request to another agency used to wait forever unless an officer clicked a
button that played the other side. Now the other side replies. The reply is
drawn at random from a set we wrote ourselves (`REPLY_SET`): nobody is
pretending to know what the Red Cross duty officer would actually say, and the
set is the honest stand-in for that person until a real channel exists.

What matters is what the agent does with each kind of answer:

  accept_full          units are staged at that agency's base and join the
                       fleet; the plan is redone so they get assigned.
  accept_partial       the units given join the fleet; the remainder is asked
                       of the next agency that holds the capability.
  delayed              acknowledged, answer again later; for a life-safety
                       capability the agent also asks a second agency (hedge),
                       because a "later" ambulance is not an ambulance.
  need_info            the agent answers with the ward, location, incident and
                       severity, and the agency replies again.
  decline_capacity     the next agency is asked; if nobody else holds the
  decline_jurisdiction capability the gap is escalated to the district EOC.

Every reply and every step is an event (`agency.replied`, `agency.requested`
with `followup_of`, `agency.clarified`, `agency.escalated`), and the exchange is
kept on the request (`replies`), so the handoff board shows the conversation.

Requests made by the surge ladder are answered by `app.surge.service` (they
have an offer with its own acceptance rate) and never get a `reply_due_at`
here, so the two never answer the same request.
