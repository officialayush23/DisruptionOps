"""Standing up a deployment, from a browser.

The portability claim has been true in the schema since the first migration:
hazards, categories, capabilities, resource kinds and lifeline kinds are rows,
not enums, so a new city needs no code. What it also needed until now was
somebody with psql, which is not a claim anybody can check in a demo and not a
thing a municipal IT department will do.

So this is that same portability, exposed. A city, its wards, its fleet, its
lifelines and its staff logins, all creatable from the configuration screen.
Nothing here is a special case: every write lands in the same tables the Pune
deployment uses, and the moment a ward exists the risk agent scores it and the
allocator can send units into it.

Two things are deliberately strict:

  * **Everything is staff-only, and creating logins is Commissioner-only.**
    A screen that can mint a ward officer account is an administrative
    interface, not a settings page.
  * **Nothing is deleted that is referenced.** A ward with incidents in it, or a
    unit with a live assignment, refuses rather than cascading. Losing the
    history is worse than keeping a row nobody wants.
