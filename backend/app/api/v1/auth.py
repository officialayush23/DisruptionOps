"""Who am I?

One endpoint, and it earns its place. The frontend gets a Supabase session from
`supabase-js`, but the session only carries what Supabase knows: a user id and
an email. It does not know whether this person is a ward officer, which ward
they hold delegation for, or which agency's field tasks they may see. That
lives in `profiles` and is resolved here, by the same code path that authorises
every other call.

So the client asks once after sign-in and renders the interface it is entitled
to, rather than guessing from the email address or trusting a claim the token
never made.
