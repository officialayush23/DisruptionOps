"""The Commissioner Copilot API.

Six endpoints, and the shape of them is the argument: everything that *reads* is
open to any staff principal, everything that *acts* is a proposal that goes
through the policy gate, and the endpoint that can move a unit
(`/copilot/apply`) records who asked and then lets the delegation matrix decide
what they may have.

`/copilot/tools` exists so the limits are visible from the same screen as the
capability. A commissioner who can read the catalogue can see that there is no
tool called `evacuate_ward`, and that the ones which change anything all route
through the gate.
