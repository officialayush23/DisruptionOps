"""Operations API: see every job, stop one, say what to do instead.

Reads are open to staff. The one write, `/ops/cancel`, is a proposal: it goes
through the policy gate as `cancel_assignment`, exactly like the Copilot's
actions, and records who asked. The officer never gets a button that bypasses
the delegation matrix; they get one that asks it.
