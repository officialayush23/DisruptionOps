"""The citizen and field surfaces.

Separate from the operations console on purpose, and not only for tidiness. A
ward officer has no use for a marker they can walk around, and a resident must
never be handed the whole fleet's position. The three interfaces answer three
different questions and they should not share an endpoint:

  * **citizen**: what is happening where I am, where should I go, and how do I
    tell someone. Scoped to their surroundings.
  * **field**: what am I assigned to, and how do I tell the control room that my
    vehicle has a puncture. Scoped to their agency.
  * **admin**: everything, and that is `demo.py`.

Scoping is enforced here and again in row level security, so this is the
convenient layer rather than the one holding the line.
