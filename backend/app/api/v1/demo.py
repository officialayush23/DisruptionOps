    Why this button is shaped the way it is
    ---------------------------------------
    The tempting version of this feature fabricates forty agreeing reporters the
    moment somebody files, so the demo looks busy. That version demonstrates the
    precise failure this system is built to prevent — `intake` scores trust
    *before* clustering exactly so that a burst cannot manufacture its own
    corroboration — and it invites the one question there would then be no good
    answer to.

    So this does the honest version, and every constraint below is there to keep
    it honest:

    * Each neighbour gets **its own device id**, because the corroboration
      component counts *independent* sources. Reports from one device do not
      corroborate each other, and a version of this that reused one id would
      show no lift at all — correctly.
    * `source="sim"`, credited at 0.62, the same as an anonymous app report.
      Not "field", not inflated. These are strangers with phones.
    * Every one is named **"Simulated neighbour"** in the database, in the
      intake inbox and in the audit log. Nobody downstream, and nobody watching,
      can mistake them for real traffic.
    * They go through `intake.receive` like everything else — same clustering,
      same trust scoring, same events. Nothing is written directly.

    What comes back is the before-and-after, because the state *change* is the
    demonstration: one report is an unconfirmed rumour, three independent ones
    clears the auto-confirm floor and the solver may commit a unit to it.
