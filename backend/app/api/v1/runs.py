"""Runs, the taxonomy, and the audit log.

Three endpoints that did not exist before and that the rest of the system needs:

  * `POST /runs` actually executes a hazard run, which is what fills every
    operational table. Until this existed the database was a well-designed
    empty room.
  * `GET /taxonomy` hands the frontend the hazards, categories, resource kinds
    and capabilities this deployment has, so the client stops hard-coding
    unions that a second city would invalidate.
  * `GET /events` is the PS20 activity and audit log, and `GET /events/{id}/chain`
    answers "why did this happen?" by walking the recorded causal chain rather
    than reconstructing it from timestamps.
