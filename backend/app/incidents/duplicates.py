"""Duplicate effort.

The deduplication in `clustering.py` stops four reports of one flooded bridge
becoming four incidents. This module catches the more expensive mistake: two
agencies dispatching into the same incident because neither could see the
other's assignments.

That is the duplication that actually wastes rescue capacity, and it is the one
most systems never surface, because you cannot see it until reports have been
clustered into incidents in the first place.

Two shapes, both queries over what is already recorded:

  * **Same incident, two agencies.** Unambiguous. Usually a handoff that was
    never acknowledged, or two control rooms working the same phone call.
  * **Different incidents, overlapping ground.** Two open incidents within a
    short distance and time of each other, each with its own units en route.
    Sometimes correct, often one event that the clustering split because the
    reports arrived far enough apart. Flagged, never auto-merged.
