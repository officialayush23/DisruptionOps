"""Report intake.

One door. Everything that claims something is happening comes through here: a
resident on the citizen portal, a field operator on a phone, an agency feed, a
sensor or gauge, and the simulator.
They differ in one field, `source`, which feeds the trust score. Nothing else
downstream can tell them apart, and that is the property the whole simulation
design rests on: a report a human types during a running simulation is processed
by this exact function and can therefore change the outcome.

The order matters and is not arbitrary:

    isolate text -> trust -> cluster -> incident -> needs -> events

Text is isolated before anything reads it, because report text is untrusted
input that later reaches a language model. Trust is scored before clustering so
a burst of fabricated reports cannot manufacture its own corroboration. Needs
are computed from the incident, not the report, because four reports of one
flooded road need one pump between them.
