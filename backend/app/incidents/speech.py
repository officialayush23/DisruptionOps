"""Reports spoken, not typed.

Typing is the wrong input for this. Somebody standing in water, on a phone, in
the dark, with one hand free, in Marathi, is not going to fill in a form — and
the fastest report is the one that needed the least from the person making it.
So: hold a button, say what you see, let go.

Sarvam's Saarika is the right model for it and the reason is narrow. It is
trained on Indian languages specifically, including code-mixed speech, which is
what people in Pune actually speak: a Marathi sentence with English nouns in it.
A general multilingual recogniser transcribes that badly, and the failure is not
random — it drops exactly the loan words ("underpass", "society", "terrace")
that carry the location.

Two modes, and which one is used is a real decision:

  * **transcribe** keeps the original language. The parser's keyword vocabulary
    is already trilingual, so "पाणी साचले आहे" matches Marathi terms directly
    and an officer reading the report afterwards sees what was actually said.
  * **translate** returns English. Used only as a fallback when the language is
    one the keyword vocabulary does not cover, because translation loses the
    idiom the parser leans on.

Never raises. Speech that cannot be transcribed leaves the person the text box
they already had.
