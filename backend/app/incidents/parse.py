"""Free text to a structured report.

People do not pick from a dropdown while standing in water. They type "road is
full of water near the bridge, cant cross" or "आजोबा अडकले आहेत" or a mix of
both, and the system has to work out what that is.

Two stages, in this order and not the other way round:

  1. **Keyword matching**, in English, Hindi, Marathi and the transliterated
     mixture people actually write. It is crude, it runs in microseconds, it
     needs no network, and on the vocabulary of a flood it is right most of the
     time. It also works on the phone, offline, which is where this eventually
     has to run.

  2. **The model**, only when stage one is not confident. It gets the text as
     quoted data, never as instructions, and it may only choose from the
     categories that exist. If it answers with anything else, or is not
     available at all, the deterministic guess stands.

The model is the fallback here, not the primary. That is deliberate: a keyword
hit is explainable to an officer afterwards and a model output is not, and on
this vocabulary the cheap method is not meaningfully worse.
