"""How much to believe a report.

A disaster platform that accepts public reports and then moves real vehicles has
an adversarial input problem whether or not it admits one. Rumour spreads faster
than verified information, and a flood of identical reports from newly created
accounts is enough to pull scarce rescue units away from the place that needs
them. That is not an exotic attack; it is what a bad afternoon on social media
does by accident.

So every report gets a score, from six components, all deterministic. The model
is not consulted. A language model deciding whether to believe a rescue call is
exactly the wrong division of labour: it would be confident, unaccountable, and
impossible to explain to an officer afterwards.

What the score controls is not truth, it is *cost*. A low-trust report is not
deleted and not called a lie. It is prevented from spending an ambulance.
