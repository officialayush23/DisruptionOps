"""Authentication.

Supabase issues the JWT; this service verifies it and resolves the caller's
role from `profiles`. The role is what the API authorises against, and it is the
same role the database policies check, so a bug in the API layer cannot grant
access the database would refuse.

Verification handles both shapes Supabase issues. A token signed with an
asymmetric key (ES256/RS256, the current default) is verified against the
project's published JWKS; a legacy HS256 token is verified against the shared
JWT secret. Which path is taken is decided per token from its header, and the
algorithm is always chosen from our own allow-list rather than from the token,
because trusting the token's `alg` field is how algorithm-confusion forgeries
work. See `app/core/jwks.py`.
