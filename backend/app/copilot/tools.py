"""What the Command Agent is allowed to know, and how it finds it out.

The rule that makes this defensible: **the model never sees the database and
never invents a number.** It sees the catalogue below, chooses a tool, and gets
back a structured result. Everything it then says is written from that result.
Take the model away and the tools still answer; the prose just gets plainer.

Three tiers, and the boundary between the second and third is the policy gate:

* **read** — facts. Cheap, safe, and the only tier a question ever needs.
* **analyse** — facts put through the solver or the forecaster. Still writes
  nothing; `simulate_*` re-solves the real allocation model on a copy.
* **act** — proposes. Never executes directly: `propose_action` goes through
  `agents.gate`, which decides whether a person has to see it first.

Each tool declares its parameters so the catalogue can be handed to a model and
shown to a user on the same screen. A commissioner who can see the list can see
the limits, which is the more important half.
