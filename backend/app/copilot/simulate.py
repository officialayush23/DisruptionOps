"""What-if, without touching the world.

Every number the Copilot quotes about a hypothetical comes from here, and here
re-solves the *same* model the live planner does: the same demands, the same
fleet, the same travel matrix, the same CP-SAT objective. The only difference is
that nothing is written and the inputs are perturbed first.

That matters more than it looks. A "simulation" that scores a hypothetical with
its own simpler arithmetic will disagree with the planner the moment somebody
acts on it, and the first time an officer notices that the preview promised
14 minutes and the dispatch produced 26, they stop trusting the preview — which
is the only part of an advisory system that has to be trusted.

Three perturbations, which is enough to answer the questions a commissioner
actually asks:

* **pin** — "what if we send A12 to Zone 4 instead". The unit is committed by
  hand and the solver optimises around that commitment, which is exactly what
  happens when a person overrules the plan.
* **surge** — "what if Zone 4 gets fifty more medical calls". Synthetic demands
  are appended and the fleet has to absorb them.
* **withdraw** — "what if we hold two ambulances in reserve". Units are taken
  out of the pool.

The comparison is always against a baseline solved in the same call, from the
same snapshot, so the two arms cannot be a minute apart in a fast-moving world.
