"""Turning an approved decision into something that actually happened.

The gap this closes: the policy gate has always been able to *record* that an
action was authorised, and nothing downstream ever carried it out. A decision
that says "move Ambulance 4 to Kothrud" and leaves the ambulance where it is is
theatre, and an officer discovers that the first time they approve something.

So every action key the Copilot can propose has an executor here, and the flow
is the same for all of them:

    propose -> gate -> authorised?  -- no --> waits on the decision gate
                          |
                         yes
                          v
                       execute -> event

An action with no executor is still proposable and still gated; it simply says
so, rather than pretending. `_EXECUTORS` is the whole list, and if a key is not
in it the decision is recorded as authorised-but-manual and the console says
"this one is yours to carry out".

Nothing here decides anything. Authority was settled before it was called.
